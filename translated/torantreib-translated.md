## Compatible drives
All drives that are compatible with the UAP1 adapter board should work.
  
Tested:
- Supramatic E3 (Index >C)
- Supramatic P3 (Index >C)

## Indications on the display
#### Display "4"
The display means, among other things, "Stop received from UAP1". The stop command is, for example, triggered by the auto-close function

#### Display "7"
The display means "Communication error with UAP1". This ad comes up every now and then, but according to my Beo

## Adjusting the ventilation position
- Move to position via button or remote control
- Long press “PRG”.
- Select menu "43" using the arrow keys
- Press "PRG" until the point "43." appears -> position saved
- Exit menu via "00" and "PRG"


## Resetting the gate drive
As soon as the UAP1 or hgdo has responded once to the gate drive's request, it will permanently expect one
- Unplug the drive
- Wait 10s
- Press and **hold** “PRG”
- Plug in the plug --> display "C"
- Release “PRG” --> Display “U”
- Set the door type with the “Up” button, e.g. “1” for sectional door
- Press “PRG” --> Display “L”
- Press "Up" --> start learning runs (7x open/close) --> then display "11" (flashing)
- Wait 25s (or "Up" to "00", then "PRG")
